# GLOF-Sensitive-Areas
Aims to find anomoly regions based on factors like Snow Albedo (reflection capacity of ice), Snow Cover,	Lake Bottom Temperature,	Total Precipitation,	Volumetric Soil,	Dew Point.

Isolation Forest and K Means were used to separate the regions as at RISKY and NOT RISKY.

Data was taken from: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview

This is part of the GLOF prediction for SIH 2024.
